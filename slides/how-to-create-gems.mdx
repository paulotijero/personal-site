# What are gems?

---

# How to create my first gem?

---

# The first step and most important! is, search for a name.

## in [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org)

---

# Create the directory & file structure

```file-tree
[
  {
    "name": "talk-with-groot",
    "type": "folder",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "lib",
        "type": "folder",
        "children": [{ "name": "talk_with_groot.rb", "type": "file" }]
      },
      {
        "name": "talk_with_groot.gemspec",
        "type": "file"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

---

# Add features in the file talk_with_groot.rb

---

![](/static/img/slide/how-to-create-gems/talk-with-groot.png)

---

# Add features in the file `.gemspec`

---

![](/static/img/slide/how-to-create-gems/gemspec.png)

---

# Add testing, but we need to create `Rakefile`

---

![](/static/img/slide/how-to-create-gems/rakefile.png)

---

# We sould also add a Gemfile that specifies our Rspec dependency.

---

![](/static/img/slide/how-to-create-gems/dependency.png)

---

# Now all we need to do is create a spec folder

```file-tree
[
  {
    "name": "talk-with-groot",
    "type": "folder",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "lib",
        "type": "folder",
        "children": [{ "name": "talk_with_groot.rb", "type": "file" }]
      },
      {
        "name": "spec",
        "type": "folder",
        "children": [{ "name": "talk_with_groot_spec.rb", "type": "file" }]
      },
      {
        "name": "talk_with_groot.gemspec",
        "type": "file"
      },
      {
        "name": "Gemfile",
        "type": "file"
      },
      {
        "name": "Rakefile",
        "type": "file"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
