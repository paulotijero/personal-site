### Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.
</div>

When I started in the world of programming the tests were a great starting point to reduce my frustration in the learning process and gain confidence in the code I wrote, now in ruby, perfect those skills, and I will show you how to learn ruby and learn test! at the same time!

### Description

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.
</div>

The first amazing thing I wrote when I started ruby was a great and beautiful "Hello world", and the second thing even more amazing was writing my first test to prove that my function would actually return a "Hello world", since then I have not stopped writing tests in everything and for everything.

It is incredible the power that gives you to write tests, that confidence in oneself at the time of programming, that feeling of "Aja! I found you" (mental phrase to find ~~beautiful~~ bugs), that paradigm shift that now you are more willing to find mistakes early or that adrenaline that one feels when running their tests and the heart begins to beat a thousand times for each little green dot that is colored in the console.

So today I have serious intentions to convince more novices like me, to start this road in ruby doing tests, sharing with everyone how I could learn ruby and their tests from a basic to advanced level using codewars and with the additional bonus that our github account will be substantially benefited.

### Notes

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
 This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...
</div>

I am a student at Codeable, a bootcamp of fullstack web developer where we build amazing things using ruby, react and more. I am excited to tell how my experience was in this learning process and how the tests helped me to understand more the fundamental concepts of ruby. My intention is to encourage more and more people to write tests, and understand the value that this represents, not only for the future of the project, but also for their own learning.
