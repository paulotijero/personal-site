  pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

Is ruby a difficult language to understand? What would happen if I told you that ruby is a human language for humans? Will ** ruby ** be a complex language to start programming? Then, we will talk about _ruby_ in _ruby_ language. And you will feel human.

### Description

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as
  possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select
  your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they
  should see.

The creator of ruby _Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto_ often mentions that he is _"trying to make Ruby natural, not simple"_ complementing this sentence by saying _"Ruby is simple in appearance, but complex inside, like the human body"_ nothing closer to the truth, and do not make mistakes when mentioning human, this being the best way to describe the ruby harmony.

And it's that just by paying attention to the details and reading the ruby lines calmly, even though I do not know how to program, I understand exactly what is going to happen, for example `5.times {print" We * love * Ruby - it's out serial!" }` and it is that in Ruby everything is an object and it is demonstrated by applying a`times` action to a number `5` It is pure Ruby magic.

Today I will share with all of you why Ruby is the best language to start in the world of programming, and we will see that you will feel human writing ruby code.

### Notes

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
  you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

I am a student at Codeable, a bootcamp for fullstack web developers where we build amazing apps similar to Slack, Netflix or Trivago using Ruby, React, and more. I am excited to tell how my experience was in this bootcamp, how Ruby made my experience the best of all in this learning process, and how it helped me internalize the fundamental concepts of programming. My intention is to encourage more and more people to start in the world of programming hand in hand with a language as beautiful and artistic as it is Ruby.
