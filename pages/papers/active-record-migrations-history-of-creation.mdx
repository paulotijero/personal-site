### Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

Active Record Migrations is what had the biggest impact on me from Ruby on Rails; the way this helps to version our database structure is the best. To show how simple and beautiful it is to write migrations, I thought about telling you a story with migrations.

### Description

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

Migrations are a convenient way to alter our database schema consistently and easily. This means that we do not have to write SQL by hand, which allows our schema and our changes to remain independent.

To internalize well the concepts of migrations on how to create, read, update and delete, a table from our database, I will tell you the history of the creation according to the biblical chapter geminis 1:27 using migrations.

### Notes

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
 This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...
</div>

I am a student at Codeable, a bootcamp for fullstack web developers where we build amazing things using Ruby, React, and more. I am excited to tell you a story using migrations. How this helps the learning process, how it facilitates to internalize concepts and let our imagination fly, inspiring more people to write stories using programming concepts.
