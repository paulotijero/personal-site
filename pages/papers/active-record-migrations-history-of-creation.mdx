Active Record Migrations is what most impact me Ruby on Rails, how this helps to version our database structure is the best, to show how simple and beautiful it is to write migrations, I encourage you to tell a story with migrations.

### Description

You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

Migrations are a convenient way to alter our database schema consistently and easily. This means that we do not have to write SQL by hand, which allows our schema and our changes to remain independent.

To internalize well the concepts of migrations on how to create, read, update and eliminate, a table from our database, I will tell you the history of the creation according to the biblical chapter geminis 1:27 using migrations.

### Notes

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
 This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

I am a student at Codeable, a bootcamp of fullstack web developer where we build amazing things using ruby, react and more. I am excited to tell you a story told with migrations, how this helps the learning process, how it facilitates to internalize concepts and let our imagination fly inspiring more people to write stories using programming concepts.
