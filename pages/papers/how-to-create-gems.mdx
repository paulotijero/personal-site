### Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator
  pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

Why are gems in ruby important? Why should I build one? The success of a gem will depend a lot on patterns of development and the application of good practices. Then, we will learn how to build a gem and have fun in the process.

### Description

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as
  possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select
  your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they
  should see.

If you want to start contributing to a community I think the first big step would be creating your own gem, regardless of whether it solves a specific problem for a lot of people, or if you just do it to have fun and have fun doing it, or just out of curiosity you start with a great "Hello world, I come in peace", there are many reasons why one can be encouraged to build a gem, the ideal would be to identify what you always repeat in all the projects that passed through your hands, and automate it, building a gem and invoking it in all the projects you need.

So, ruby is a powerful language, and very clear to read, building a gem is the most fun thing in the world. We will learn how to create gems, with crazy and funny ideas, maybe it will not help anyone, but I am sure we will have fun in the process.

### Notes

<div css={{ color: "#888", fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.8em" }}>
  This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
  you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

I am a student at Codeable, a bootcamp of fullstack web developer where we build amazing things using ruby, react and more. I am excited to tell how my life has changed to share resources with the community, my intention is to spread all that emotion so that more and more people can start their journey in programming with ruby technologies and all that ecosystem.
