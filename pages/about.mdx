I am a Software Engineer focused on the creation and development of disruptive ideas that help improve the quality of life of people. My development stack is made up of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React. I help and share my knowledge with anyone who wants to start in the world of web development.

Presentations:

Are you organizing an event somewhere in the world and want me to offer one of my talks at your event? Do not hesitate to contact me, I enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge with the technological community.
